#### What is tree shaking?

The Tree Shaking is a concept of dead code elimination from projects. The code present in your project but neither referenced nor used will be dropped here. It will eliminate the unused modules during the build process, making user application lightweight.


#### What is Jenkins?

Jenkins is a free open source Continuous Integration tool and automation server to monitor continuous integration and delivery. It is written in Java.

It is known as an automated Continuous Delivery tool that helps to build and test the software system with easy integration of changes to the system. Jenkins follows Groovy Scripting.
